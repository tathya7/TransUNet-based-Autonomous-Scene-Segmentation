# Automatic Scene Segmentation using UNET architectures. 


### Overview 
This project implements automatic scene segmentation using  deep learning architectures: UNET CNN, Transformer-UNET, and Swin Transformer UNET. It aims to provide accurate pixel-wise segmentation for applications in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and urban planning. Our aim is to compare and predict the hypothesis if Transformers are better than Convolution Neural Networks or not.
